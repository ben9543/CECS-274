1. Time complexity
Merge sort gives you guaranteed time complexity of O(nlog(n))
Quick sort gives you faster average time complexity (2n*ln(n) + O(n)) than merge sort.

But quick sort does not guarantee the time complexity of O(nlog(n)). In the worst case,
it gives you O(n^2)

Merge sort is comparing two partitioned arrays and inserting the smallest element from the left
Quick sort is comparing two partitioned arrays and swaping elements that are bigger than pivot 
in left and smaller than pivot in right
