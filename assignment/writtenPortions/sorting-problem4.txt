Q4. What is the advantage and disadvantage of Sorting and BinarySearch over BinarySearchTree
and heaps data structures.

Online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion. In contrast, 
an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output 
an answer which solves the problem at hand.

Since most of the time online algorithms cannot match the performance of offline algorithms,
