4. What is the advantage and disadvantage of BinarySearchTree over HashTable data structures.

When you want to find an element by its value, BST gives you the best time-complexity among all those data structures.
But when you have to access the element often, using hashtable is much efficient.
So probably the best way of using BST is combining it with hashtable since you can search fast and then if you need it, 
you can store it in hashtable so that you can access it easily by its key with O(1) time comeplexity.
