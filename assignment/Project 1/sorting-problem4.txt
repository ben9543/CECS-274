Q4. What is the advantage and disadvantage of Sorting and BinarySearch over BinarySearchTree
and heaps data structures.

Online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion. In contrast, 
an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output 
an answer which solves the problem at hand.

Most of the Sorting algorithm and BinarySearch are offline algorithms. It can be more efficient, but 
we always have to indicate and provide additional inputs.

BST and Heap data structures uses online algorithms. They can be performed by giving only the root node,
but it may not be efficient in the manner of time compared to sorting algorithm and binaryserach.
