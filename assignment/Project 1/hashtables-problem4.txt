Q. What is the advantage and disadvantage of Hash Tables over Array-Based and Linked list
data structures.

Hash Tables have advantages with Time complexity over Array-Based and Linked list data structures,
since it takes O(n) time complexity to find an element. Also we are able to index elements by their keys.
But have disadvantages with Space complexity compared to Array-Based and Linked list data structures,
since Hash Tables take up more memory.
